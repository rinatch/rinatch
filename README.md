#### Hi there, my name is RinatðŸ‘‹

I currently work at Western Digital Corporation helping develop embedded flash memory devices. Plus, I am part of the companyâ€™s brand ambassadors. 

 I previously worked at the Cyber Education Center where I taught intro to SW/ HW courses for intelligent teenagers from peripheral cities aiming to expose them to the high-tech world and to prepare them for military service at elite technological units.

 I can wholeheartedly say that I'm a volunteer since I always find myself helping others in the fields of my expertise.

My Technology Stack:



ðŸ“Œ C, C++, Java, Python



ðŸ“Œ MATLAB, VHDL, Assembly, Bash (Linux), Verilog, SystemVerilog
